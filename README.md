# Simple Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects. These projects are suitable for beginners and anyone looking to strengthen their Python skills. Each project comes with a brief description to help you get acquainted with its content.

## Project List

1. **Calculation of area and perimeter.py**:
    Geometric Shape Calculator
    This Python program allows users to calculate the area and perimeter of various geometric shapes. Users can choose from the following options:

    *Square:
    Enter the length of the square‚Äôs side to calculate its area and perimeter.
    *Rectangle:
    Provide the width and height of the rectangle to compute its area and perimeter.
    *Circle:
    Input the radius of the circle to determine its area and circumference.
    *Triangle:
    Specify the base and height of the triangle to find its area.
    Note: To calculate the perimeter of the triangle, the lengths of all three sides are needed.

   ## How to Use
    Run the program.
    Enter the number corresponding to the shape you want to calculate (e.g., enter ‚Äú1‚Äù for a square).
    Follow the prompts to input the required dimensions (side length, width, height, or radius).
    The program will display the calculated area and perimeter.
    Feel free to modify and enhance this program for your own projects. Happy coding! üöÄ

3. **time calcature.py**:
    *Seconds to Time Converter
    This Python program allows users to convert a given number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. The user enters the total number of seconds, and the program calculates the equivalent time.

    ## How to Use
    Run the program.
    Enter the number of seconds.
    The program will display the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
    Feel free to use and modify this program for your own projects. Happy coding! üöÄ

4. **true mobile format number.py**:
    Soon this file will be updated for mobile numbers of all countries in the world. Currently, it is only optimized for Iranian mobile numbers.
